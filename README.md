## 🧼 Step 1: Prep Your Nails & Cuticles

1. Apply a cuticle softener. 🧴  
2. Gently push back your cuticles with a cuticle pusher. ✨  
3. Use small scissors to carefully trim the cuticle (this gives you a bigger “canvas” for your art 🎨).  
   > ⚠️ Be cautious—don’t overdo it, or you might accidentally cut yourself! 😬  
4. Wipe your nails with an alcohol-soaked pad to clean off any dead skin. 🧼

## 🪞 Step 2: Buff It Up!

Take a nail buffer and gently roughen up the surface of your nails.  
This step helps your nail polish stick better and last longer. 💪✨

## 🎨 Step 3: Time to Paint!

1. Start with a **base coat**.  
   > ⚠️ Be careful not to let it touch your skin or cuticles—otherwise, it could lift and peel in just a few days, and it might sting a bit when you cure it under the UV lamp. 😢💡  
2. Let your creativity flow and create your masterpiece! 💅🎨  
3. Finish with a **top coat** to seal the deal and protect your design. 🛡️✨

## 💡 Improvements & Tips

- **Hydrate Your Nails**:  
  After cleaning your nails, apply a nourishing oil or moisturizer to keep your skin and cuticles healthy. 🌿  
- **Thin Layers Work Best**:  
  Always apply thin layers of polish to avoid bubbling or uneven texture. *Patience is key!* 🕰️  
- **Clean Mistakes Quickly**:  
  If you accidentally paint your skin, use a small brush dipped in acetone to clean it before it dries. 🖌️
